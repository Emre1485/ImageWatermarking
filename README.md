# ImageWatermarking
This project requires an **'image.png'** file (the image in which you want to hide data) and a **'secret.txt'** file containing the message to hide.
After creating the required files, simply run the main app. 
It will hide the data from 'secret.txt' in the 'modified.png' file and then extract the message from it.
